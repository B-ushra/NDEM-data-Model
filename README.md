# NDEM-data-Model
Implementation of the NIEM-Based Data Exchange Model (NDEM) for standardizing communication between heterogeneous drones. This repository demonstrates conversion of raw telemetry and command data from a Hexacopter and CoDrone Edu into the NDEM XML format.

This project showcases a prototype implementation of the NDEM (NIEM-Based Data Exchange Model) to enable interoperable communication between heterogeneous UAVs. The system converts raw drone data — including telemetry, sensor, and command messages — from a Hexacopter and CoDrone Edu into a standardized NDEM-compliant XML format. The goal is to demonstrate a unified data model for multi-agency drone operations using NIEM principles.
